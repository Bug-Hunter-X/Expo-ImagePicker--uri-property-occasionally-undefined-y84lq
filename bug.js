This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The issue arises when attempting to access the `uri` property of an image object returned by the library. In certain situations, this property might be undefined or null, resulting in unexpected crashes or errors within your application. This is especially likely when dealing with images that fail to upload or process correctly or if there is an issue with the ImagePicker's internal mechanisms. The problem appears inconsistently, making it hard to reproduce and debug.
