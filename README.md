# Expo ImagePicker: uri Property Occasionally Undefined

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's ImagePicker library where the `uri` property of the returned image object is sometimes undefined or null. This inconsistency leads to unexpected application crashes or errors when accessing image URIs, particularly following unsuccessful uploads or processing.  The issue's sporadic nature makes consistent reproduction difficult.

## Steps to Reproduce

While precise reproduction steps are elusive due to the bug's inconsistent nature, it is most likely to occur when:

1.  Network connectivity issues interrupt image upload or processing.
2.  The user interrupts the image selection process.
3.  An internal error within the ImagePicker library occurs.

## Workaround (Solution)

The included `bugSolution.js` file offers a workaround to mitigate the issue by implementing null checks before accessing the `uri` property. This approach prevents crashes and allows for more graceful handling of potential errors.  This solution requires thorough error handling to avoid disruption of user experience.

## Additional Notes

This bug might be related to underlying issues in Expo's ImagePicker implementation or interactions with the device's image processing capabilities.  Further investigation may be needed to determine the root cause and a more robust solution.
